        "   - If the median is near the center of the box, the data is relatively **symmetrical**. If the median is closer to one quartile (Q1 or Q3), it suggests a **skewed distribution**.\n",

        "#### 2. **Spread of the Data**:\n",
        "   - The **box** (the interquartile range) tells you how spread out the middle 50% of the data is. A **larger box** indicates more spread (higher variability), while a **smaller box** indicates that the data is more concentrated around the median.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Skewness**:\n",
        "   - If the median is **closer to Q1** (the bottom of the box) and the whisker extends farther to the top, the data is **positively skewed** (skewed right).\n",

        "if one of its tails (the lower or upper end of the distribution) is longer or fatter than the other,\n",
        "causing the data to be unevenly distributed. Skewness is important because it affects\n",
        "the interpretation of the data, particularly in terms of the mean, median, and overall data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a distribution is perfectly symmetric, it has **zero skewness**.\n",
